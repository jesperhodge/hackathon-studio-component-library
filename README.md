# hackathon-studio-component-library
Component Library for Studio as a hackathon project. Built on top of Paragon.

### Setup

`npm install`
`npm run storybook`
Some storybook addon and paragon dependencies were a bit tricky to work out.
Due to this, for now, the npm ci or install with legacy peer deps seems necessary.
